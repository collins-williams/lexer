lexer
=====

Ruby code for a file scanner that allows the user to add a set of Ruby regular expressions and 
then go through a file that returning chunks that match one of the regular expressions.   

Plan
  add the ability to take a grammar from a file(s)
  then, separately, add the ability to have tokens call out?
